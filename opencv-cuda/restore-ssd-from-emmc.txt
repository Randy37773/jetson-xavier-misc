This is the [guide from support](https://github.com/Randy37773/jetson-xavier-misc/blob/main/opencv-cuda/logs/Jetson-Xavier-recover-SSD-from-eMMC.pdf) - untested.

It worked for me, to restore my SSD-file-system from eMMC within 15 minutes.

I use `nano` to edit conf-files in terminal
(doing backup-copies before modifying is always a good idea)

* `df -h` confirm that SSD is mounted at `/` (root)
* `sudo nano /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`
   * change: `root=/dev/nvme0n1p1` ->  `root=/dev/mmcblk0p1` 
* filemanager: find path for internal storage (<path-to-emmc>) 
   *  `sudo nano <path-to-emmc>/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`
      * change: `root=/dev/nvme0n1p1` -> `root=/dev/mmcblk0p1` 
* sudo reboot
  * `df -h`  confirm, that eMMC is now mounted at `/` 
*  format SSD  ext4 (e.g. via gnome-disks - quick-format)
	* sudo reboot
  * `df -h`  confirm, that eMMC is now mounted at `/` 
*  format SSD  ext4 (e.g. via gnome-disks - quick-format)
  * volue name `rootFS`, internal disk for use with lunux systems only (ext4)
* download and extract [this zipped script](https://github.com/mistelektronik/forecr_blog_files/raw/master/change_rootfs_storage_direct-emmc_to_ssd.zip) 
  * the script uses `rsync` to copy and then undoes the manual modifications in the conf-files
* `sudo ./change_rootfs_storage_direct-emmc_to_ssd.sh /dev/nvme0n1p1` ... some minutes
* `sudo reboot` 
* `df  -h`  to check if ssd is correctly mounted as `/` again
